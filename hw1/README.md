![alt-text](images/rh.png)


## Overview and Origin

Robinhood markets was founded in 2013 by Vladimir Tenev & Baiju Bhatt who had previously built high frequency trading platforms.
They are a brokerage firm with an ambitious mission statement “democratize finance for all”.
They started by introducing commission free trading of stocks & have later expanded to options & other crypto related securities.
Robinhood’s primary platform was on mobile & eventually expanded to web platform s well.
Their revolutionary move not only brought millions of new users to the retail stock market but also forced other big brokerage firms slash the commissions.

In April 2017, Robinhood raised $110 million at a $1.3 billion valuation & continued to raise more private equity.
The company eventually went IPO at a $32 billion after selling shares in IPO at $38 per share.


## Business Activities:

Robinhood’s USP is the fact that they do not charge any commission for their users’ trades.
Yes, this disrupted this market but this is also where Robinhood sort of struggles to bring in consistent revenue.
The company has 3 primary sources of revenue:

1. Payment for order flow tone excepted by the market makers.
2. Premium tier service with features like instant deposits & margin calls.
3. Interest earned on unused cash balances in their customers’ accounts.

Robinhood tries to make investing accessible for retain investors more attractive by cutting down the commissions.
They pride themselves of making investing more easily understandable with their super simple & a fluid UI from the their mobile phones.
They are also one of the few brokers to offer fractional shares, after-hours trading & crypto trading for free.
It also has more ambitious plans to expand to international markets, rolling out crypto wallets to their customers.


## Landscape:

The trading / investing landscape has been the same for quite some time even after the internet & smart phones.
Few new investors entered the arena each year. But the last few years have been different. Robinhood made investing more accessible for a common man by bringing investing easy from your phones. Also, the rent crypto boom & the trading of meme stocks have made the retail investor an integral part of how the stock prices move.

All these have contributed to meteoric rise of retail trading volume. Lot of the millennials prefer making investing decisions from their phone.
So, several big players in this domain have started investing to make their mobile platform easy to use & robust.

Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Bank of America, JP Morgan are all big players that Robinhood competes with in this domain.
However, there are also also new fintech companies like Sofi, Acorns that might pose a challenge to Robinhood in the near future.
Additionally, Coinbase is the biggest player in the Crypto trading platform space.


## Results:

Robinhood has certainly disrupted the investment market. They have 22 million funded accounts & $98 Billiion asset in custody.
These users (at least 90%) would have not invested in the stock market but for Robinhood.

The number of funded accounts, the assets under management (AUM) & the average account value per account are some of the key metrics used to
The year over year growth of these funded accounts & AUM have been super impressive but the growth of the average assets per client is only around $5000.
Comparing this with Charles Schwab for instance - they have nearly 40 million accounts with an average assets per client around $200,000.

Some of these big players however manage the 401k & RSUs for several corporations.
Hence, it may take a while for Robinhood to catch up on these metrics but they have tremendous opportunity if they make right decisions & execute well.


## Recommendations:

One of the skepticism around Robinhood is how they ”gamified” investing for the new generation.
This is true to an extent as well - They try to promote their users to make more trades rather than providing enough tools to make more informed decision.

- They could provide a dashboard where they let the users see details about the companies of interest. This could range from the financials to technicals of a certain stock.
- Stock comparisons - Based on the above information help users compare stocks that may be of interest.
- Hedging suggestions - Most investments might benefit from a good hedge. Providing suggestions / tools to identify what might be a good hedge for a $1000 investment will help their users reduce their risks.
- Web UI improvements - They started out as a mobile only platform but they have a web interface which is mediocre. If this is a conscious decision to have their users hooked to their phones & make more trades that is not going to help. Making a solid UI on the web will help users navigate better & fetch the necessary information & make more informed decisions. This will also help convince the users that this is not just a ‘game’

The above features / improvements will not only lead to happier & informed investors, it will also increase the confidence in Robinhood form this users.
This should translate into better customer retention & growth of the AUM which would likely lead to more profitability.

Analysis of the historical data & presenting them in a useful form the users will likely need data big data & data visualization tools.
Also natural language processing could be handy to make the querying simpler for thee users.
